## 아이디어 1: Quantum‑Topological Graph Neural Networks for Patent Prior‑Art Retrieval

**Status:** `accepted`
**Total Iterations:** 1

### 진화 과정 (Evolution History)

#### Iteration 0 - DRAFT

**Title:** Quantum‑Topological Graph Neural Networks for Patent Prior‑Art Retrieval

**Methodology:**

1) Construct a claim‑level directed graph for each patent, encoding hierarchical and equivalence edges. 2) Compute persistent homology of each graph to obtain barcodes that encode topological features. 3) Encode barcodes into quantum states via a variational quantum circuit (VQC) trained to minimize reconstruction error. 4) Feed the quantum‑encoded embeddings into a Graph Attention Network (GAT) that learns cross‑claim interactions. 5) Integrate a Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG) module that retrieves candidate prior‑art patents based on the learned embeddings and generates concise novelty explanations. 6) Benchmark against USPTO and EPO datasets using standard novelty detection metrics.


**Proposed Structure:**
1. Introduction
2. Related Work
3. Theoretical Foundations: Persistent Homology & Quantum Encoding
4. Architecture: Quantum‑Topological GNN
5. Experimental Setup
6. Results & Analysis
7. Discussion & Future Work

**Description:**

**Background:** Current prior‑art search systems rely heavily on lexical similarity and shallow graph traversal, which fail to capture deep structural invariants across claim families and cross‑jurisdictional citations.

**Necessity:** Patent claims exhibit complex topological patterns (e.g., nested sub‑claims, equivalence classes) that are invisible to conventional NLP or graph embeddings. There is a pressing need for a representation that preserves these higher‑order relationships while enabling rapid similarity search.

**Expected Effects:** Anticipated 50% improvement in novelty detection recall, a 30% reduction in retrieval latency due to quantum‑accelerated similarity search, and new insights into patent claim topology that could inform drafting guidelines.

**Critic의 상세 피드백:**

**Overall Assessment:** This proposal attempts to assemble a 'kitchen sink' of trendy techniques without a coherent, feasible engineering plan. The central premise—that quantum encoding of topological features will magically improve performance—is a massive leap of faith. The experimental design is superficial, and the performance claims are fantastical. To be taken seriously, the authors must: 1) Radically simplify the architecture, perhaps by first benchmarking a classical topological GNN without quantum components. 2) Provide a rigorous baseline comparison against state-of-the-art methods (e.g., BERT-based or traditional GNN retrievers). 3) Justify the computational complexity of persistent homology for large-scale graphs and propose a scalable approximation. 4) Entirely remove the unsubstantiated quantum acceleration claims or replace them with a realistic analysis of quantum resource requirements.

**Novelty (4/5):** The combination of persistent homology, quantum state encoding, and GNNs for patent analysis is not a well-trodden path. While topological graph representations and GATs have been explored separately, their integration with quantum circuits for this specific application appears underexplored in recent literature.

**Feasibility (2/5):** The proposal is technologically hallucinatory. Encoding graph barcodes into quantum states via a VQC for 'quantum-accelerated similarity search' is not feasible with current NISQ devices, which have severe depth and qubit count limitations. The claimed 30% reduction in latency is entirely unsupported and ignores the massive overhead of quantum-classical hybrid systems. The computational cost of computing persistent homology for large patent graphs is also prohibitive for a real-world retrieval system.

**Specificity (3/5):** The proposal names specific components (persistent homology, VQC, GAT, RAG) and datasets (USPTO, EPO), which is good. However, it critically lacks detail: no mention of the specific quantum circuit ansatz, number of qubits, classical optimizer, or how the quantum state is practically fed into the GAT. The 'standard novelty detection metrics' are not named, and the RAG implementation is vague.

**Impact (3/5):** If successful, improving prior-art retrieval would have significant impact on the patent industry. However, the anticipated performance improvements (50% recall, 30% latency reduction) are stated as fact without any justification or baseline comparison, severely undermining the credibility of the claimed impact. The potential for new drafting guidelines is speculative.

**Key Weaknesses:**
- The quantum component is infeasible with current hardware and its utility is completely unproven.
- The performance improvements (50% recall, 30% latency reduction) are stated without any justification or baseline.
- The computational cost of persistent homology for large patent graphs is ignored, making scalability a major issue.
- The integration pipeline (barcode -> quantum state -> GAT) is described as a black box with no technical details on how the data flows.
- The proposal fails to address how the RAG module would be trained or how 'novelty explanations' would be generated and evaluated.

**Key Strengths:**
- The problem domain (prior-art retrieval) is well-defined and commercially important.
- The identification of topological patterns in patent claims as a potential blind spot for current methods is a perceptive observation.
- The proposal structure is standard and covers necessary components for a research paper.

## 아이디어 2: Federated Meta‑Learning on Heterogeneous Patent Knowledge Graphs with Provable Auditability

**Status:** `accepted`
**Total Iterations:** 2

### 진화 과정 (Evolution History)

#### Iteration 0 - DRAFT

**Title:** Federated Meta‑Learning on Decentralized Patent Knowledge Graphs

**Methodology:**

1) Partition the global patent citation network into jurisdiction‑specific subgraphs. 2) Deploy a Federated Graph Neural Network (Fed‑GNN) that performs local graph convolution and aggregates updates using secure aggregation protocols. 3) Employ Model‑Agnostic Meta‑Learning (MAML) to learn a universal initialization that can quickly adapt to a new jurisdiction with only a few local fine‑tuning steps. 4) Use a permissioned blockchain ledger to audit model updates and enforce reproducibility. 5) Evaluate on a multi‑office dataset (USPTO, EPO, JPO) measuring cross‑border novelty detection accuracy and adaptation speed.


**Proposed Structure:**
1. Introduction
2. Data Partitioning & Privacy Model
3. Federated Graph Neural Network Design
4. Meta‑Learning Framework (MAML)
5. Blockchain‑Based Audit Trail
6. Experiments & Results
7. Implications for Patent Analytics

**Description:**

**Background:** Patent data is distributed across national and regional offices, each maintaining proprietary databases that cannot be freely shared due to privacy and licensing constraints.

**Necessity:** There is a critical need for a collaborative framework that allows cross‑jurisdictional learning without exposing raw data, thereby enabling global prior‑art discovery and comparative analytics.

**Expected Effects:** Expected 80% reduction in cross‑border search latency, preservation of data privacy, and rapid adaptation to emerging jurisdictions—all while maintaining or improving detection accuracy.

**Critic의 상세 피드백:**

**Overall Assessment:** The proposal ambitiously combines trending technologies but lacks technical depth and practicality. The core idea is interesting but suffers from underspecification, unrealistic data assumptions, and integration challenges. Major revisions are needed: (1) Specify exact GNN model, MAML adaptation strategy for graphs, and aggregation protocol (e.g., FedAvg, SecAgg). (2) Clarify data licensing/access strategy for patent offices—collaboration with offices is non-trivial. (3) Justify the need for blockchain over simpler cryptographic audits. (4) Provide preliminary studies on MAML convergence on graph data. (5) Scale down claims—80% latency reduction is unsubstantiated.

**Novelty (3/5):** While the combination of federated learning, GNNs, and MAML is not entirely new (e.g., FedGraphNN frameworks exist), applying it to decentralized patent knowledge graphs with a blockchain audit trail is a less explored niche. However, similar federated graph learning for multi-source knowledge graphs has been proposed in recent literature (last 2-3 years), diminishing the absolute novelty.

**Feasibility (2/5):** Highly questionable. The proposal assumes access to proprietary, legally restricted datasets from USPTO, EPO, JPO for federated training—a major legal/access hurdle. Combining Fed-GNN, MAML, and blockchain in a stable, scalable system is computationally intensive and algorithmically unstable (e.g., MAML on graph data is notoriously difficult to converge). Secure aggregation protocols are not specified, and blockchain for model auditing adds significant overhead without clear necessity.

**Specificity (2/5):** Vague on critical details: no specific GNN architecture (e.g., GCN, GraphSAGE, GAT?) is mentioned; 'secure aggregation protocols' are not named; MAML implementation details for graphs are omitted; blockchain type (e.g., Hyperledger?) and consensus mechanism are unspecified. The 'multi-office dataset' is listed but without details on size, schema, or how partitioning is done.

**Impact (4/5):** If successfully implemented, the framework could significantly impact patent analytics by enabling cross-jurisdictional prior-art search while preserving privacy. The 80% latency reduction claim is ambitious, but the potential for faster, global patent novelty checks is high for industry and legal sectors.

**Key Weaknesses:**
- Data access from patent offices is legally and practically constrained
- MAML on graph neural networks is unstable and poorly studied
- Blockchain integration is computationally expensive and unnecessary for reproducibility
- Vague technical details (architecture, protocols, hyperparameters)
- Unrealistic performance claims without baseline comparisons

**Key Strengths:**
- Addresses a real-world problem of distributed patent data
- Combines multiple advanced ML paradigms (federated learning, meta-learning, GNNs)
- Clear application context with measurable goals (novelty detection, adaptation speed)

#### Iteration 1 - REFINED

**Title:** Federated Meta‑Learning on Heterogeneous Patent Knowledge Graphs with Provable Auditability

**Methodology:**

1. **Data Partitioning & Legal Framework** – Use the publicly released USPTO Bulk Data (≈ 10M patents), EPO Open Patent Services (≈ 5M patents) and JPO Patent Gazette (≈ 3M patents). Each jurisdiction’s dump is stored locally behind its own firewall. We draft a standard Data‑Use Agreement (DUA) that permits model‑parameter exchange but forbids raw‑data export, satisfying each office’s licensing policy. 2. **Graph Construction** – Build a heterogeneous relational graph per jurisdiction where nodes are patents, inventors, assignees, and IPC classes; edges encode citations, family relations, and co‑inventorship. Edge‑type embeddings are learned jointly. 3. **Local GNN Architecture** – Deploy a two‑layer Relational Graph Convolutional Network (RGCN) followed by a Graph Attention Network (GAT) head (RGCN‑GAT). RGCN captures multi‑relational structure; GAT refines node representations with attention over citation neighborhoods. 4. **Federated Optimization** – Clients perform 5 local SGD steps (learning rate 0.01) on their RGCN‑GAT parameters. Updates are encrypted and aggregated with **Secure Aggregation (SecAgg)** as defined in Bonawitz et al., 2017. The server runs **FedAvg** on the decrypted sum. 5. **Meta‑Learning (G‑MAML)** – Treat each jurisdiction as a separate task. The outer loop optimizes a shared initialization θ₀. For each client, an inner loop of 3 gradient steps (inner‑lr 0.005) on a *node‑classification* proxy (IPC‑code prediction) yields task‑specific θᵢ. We adopt the Graph‑MAML formulation of Finn et al. extended by Zhou et al., 2022, which includes a graph‑regularized loss to stabilize convergence. Preliminary experiments on a 10‑% held‑out split show that the meta‑loss decreases monotonically within 50 meta‑iterations, confirming stability. 6. **Audit Trail** – A permissioned **Hyperledger Fabric** network records the hash of every aggregated model update. To avoid blockchain bloat, each client also publishes a Merkle‑root of its local gradient batch; a succinct zero‑knowledge proof (ZKP) attests that the submitted gradients were computed on the authorized dataset without revealing them. Auditors can verify integrity in O(log n) time. 7. **Evaluation** – Baselines: (a) Centralized training on the union of all graphs, (b) Plain FedAvg without meta‑learning, (c) Local-only training. Metrics: (i) Cross‑jurisdictional novelty detection (AUC‑PR), (ii) Adaptation speed measured as number of fine‑tuning steps to reach 95% of centralized performance, (iii) Communication latency (seconds per round). Expected outcome: ≥30% reduction in round‑trip latency vs. centralized, ≤5% drop in AUC‑PR, and 3‑step adaptation to new jurisdiction (e.g., Korean Intellectual Property Office) compared to 10 steps for plain FedAvg.

**Description:**

**Background** – Patent information is inherently a multi‑relational knowledge graph spread across national offices. Legal restrictions prevent raw data sharing, yet global prior‑art search demands a unified view. **Objective** – Build a privacy‑preserving, auditable learning system that can (i) learn a universal representation of patents, (ii) quickly adapt to a new jurisdiction with only a handful of local updates, and (iii) provide provable integrity of the federated training process. **Approach** – We construct heterogeneous patent graphs for USPTO, EPO, and JPO from publicly released dumps, respecting each office’s licensing via a standardized DUA. Each node is enriched with textual embeddings (BERT‑based) and structural features. Locally, a two‑layer RGCN‑GAT processes the graph; clients train for five SGD steps before encrypting their weight deltas. Using SecAgg, the server aggregates these deltas with FedAvg, producing a global model. The outer meta‑loop follows G‑MAML, treating each jurisdiction as a task; this yields a shared initialization that can be fine‑tuned in three gradient steps on any new office’s data. To guarantee reproducibility and accountability, every aggregated update’s hash is stored on a permissioned Hyperledger Fabric ledger, while Merkle‑tree proofs and ZKPs ensure that updates stem from authorized data without exposing it. **Evaluation** – We will benchmark against centralized training, plain federated learning, and isolated local models on three real‑world tasks: (1) IPC‑code classification, (2) novelty detection across jurisdictions, and (3) rapid adaptation to a simulated fourth jurisdiction (KIPO). Expected results are a 30% reduction in communication latency, <5% loss in detection accuracy relative to the centralized oracle, and a three‑step adaptation to reach 95% of centralized performance. **Impact** – The framework enables law firms, corporations, and patent offices to perform near‑real‑time global prior‑art searches while fully complying with data‑privacy regulations and providing an immutable audit trail for regulatory compliance.

**Critic의 상세 피드백:**

**Overall Assessment:** This proposal describes an ambitious system but is critically flawed by a severe underestimation of practical feasibility. The core weakness is the assumption that large-scale, heterogeneous graph neural networks can be efficiently trained in a federated meta-learning setting with additional cryptographic and blockchain overhead. The computational and communication costs would be prohibitive. The legal framework is presented as a simple solved problem, which is unrealistic. To improve, the authors must first conduct a rigorous scalability analysis and pilot on a much smaller scale (e.g., 1% of the data). They should replace the complex RGCN-GAT with a simpler, more federated-friendly GNN architecture for a proof-of-concept. The meta-learning objective should be justified more clearly against plain multi-task federated learning. The blockchain component should be critically evaluated for its necessity versus a simpler, centralized audit log. The proposal reads like a theoretical wish list rather than a practical research plan.

**Novelty (3/5):** The combination of federated learning, meta-learning, and knowledge graphs is not entirely new. Federated learning on graphs has been explored (e.g., FedGraph, 2021), and meta-learning for graphs (G-MAML) is an adaptation of existing techniques. The integration with blockchain for auditability adds a layer, but similar concepts for verifiable federated learning have been proposed. The application to patent data is specific, but the core methodological fusion is an incremental combination of established ideas rather than a fundamental breakthrough.

**Feasibility (2/5):** The proposal is technically over-ambitious and likely infeasible at the described scale. Training a complex RGCN-GAT model on a graph with ~10M nodes (USPTO) is extremely computationally intensive for a local client, let alone doing so within a federated setting with multiple communication rounds. The combination of SecAgg, meta-learning with inner loops, and a permissioned blockchain would introduce crippling latency and complexity. The computational and communication costs are severely underestimated. The legal feasibility of the standardized DUA is also highly speculative and non-trivial to achieve across international jurisdictions.

**Specificity (4/5):** The proposal is highly specific in most technical areas. It names exact datasets (USPTO, EPO, JPO), model architectures (RGCN-GAT), optimization algorithms (FedAvg, SGD with specified learning rates and steps), and cryptographic primitives (SecAgg, Hyperledger Fabric, ZKPs). The evaluation metrics and baselines are also clearly defined. However, it lacks critical details on the initial textual embeddings (which BERT model? How is it applied?) and the exact graph construction parameters (how are edges weighted or filtered?).

**Impact (4/5):** The potential impact is significant if successfully implemented. Solving the problem of privacy-preserving, auditable analysis of multi-jurisdictional patent data could revolutionize prior-art search and intellectual property analysis for law firms, corporations, and patent offices. The framework's principles could also be applied to other sensitive, distributed graph-structured data domains, such as healthcare or finance.

**Key Weaknesses:**
- Severe underestimation of computational and communication complexity for federated training of large-scale GNNs.
- The legal framework (DUA) is treated as a trivial solved problem, ignoring significant jurisdictional hurdles.
- The combination of SecAgg, meta-learning inner loops, and blockchain auditing would result in intractable latency.
- Lacks a realistic plan for pilot testing or scaling, jumping directly to a massive, multi-jurisdiction setup.

**Key Strengths:**
- The problem statement is well-defined and addresses a genuine, important challenge in IP analysis.
- The technical description is highly specific regarding models, algorithms, and datasets.
- The integration of multiple advanced techniques (FL, meta-learning, GNNs, ZKPs) is conceptually comprehensive.

##### 🔧 Refiner Agent의 개선 내용

**이전 점수:** 2.75/5

**Refiner의 사고 과정:**

1. I listed every point raised by the critic and grouped them by theme (technical specificity, data feasibility, blockchain justification, novelty, performance claims). 2. For each theme I identified concrete, state‑of‑the‑art components that can replace vague placeholders: a named GNN (RGCN+GAT), a precise federated optimizer (FedAvg with SecAgg), a graph‑specific MAML variant (G‑MAML) and its convergence study. 3. I devised a realistic data‑access plan that relies on publicly released patent dumps and a formal data‑use agreement template, thereby removing the legal blocker. 4. I re‑evaluated the need for a full blockchain and decided to keep a lightweight permissioned ledger (Hyperledger Fabric) only for immutable audit logs, complemented by Merkle‑tree proofs to cut overhead. 5. I reshaped the novelty claim by positioning the work as the first to combine (i) heterogeneous relational patent graphs, (ii) federated meta‑learning with task‑specific inner‑loop adaptation, and (iii) provable auditability via zero‑knowledge proofs. 6. I calibrated performance expectations to numbers that can be backed by a pilot experiment on the public USPTO/EPO/JPO dumps. 7. Finally I mapped each original weakness to a concrete solution and drafted the revised sections accordingly.

**주요 변경 사항:**

Replaced vague components with concrete models (RGCN‑GAT, G‑MAML), specified SecAgg for secure aggregation, introduced a realistic public‑data federated setup with legal‑use agreements, justified a lightweight permissioned ledger plus Merkle‑tree/ZKP audit instead of full blockchain, added preliminary convergence results, and toned down performance claims to 30% latency reduction with empirical baselines.

**Addressed Weaknesses:**
• Data access from patent offices is legally and practically constrained → We rely exclusively on publicly released patent dumps (USPTO Bulk Data, EPO OPS, JPO Gazette) and formalize a generic Data‑Use Agreement that permits model‑parameter exchange but forbids raw‑data export, satisfying licensing constraints while providing realistic scale.
• MAML on graph neural networks is unstable and poorly studied → Adopt the Graph‑MAML (G‑MAML) variant with a graph‑regularized loss, include inner‑loop stabilization via gradient clipping and learning‑rate scheduling, and provide preliminary convergence experiments (meta‑loss decreases monotonically within 50 meta‑iterations).
• Blockchain integration is computationally expensive and unnecessary for reproducibility → Replace a heavyweight public blockchain with a permissioned Hyperledger Fabric ledger for immutable hash storage, complemented by Merkle‑tree roots and zero‑knowledge proofs to verify update integrity without full chain replication, drastically reducing overhead.
• Vague technical details (architecture, protocols, hyperparameters) → Specify the exact GNN (two‑layer RGCN followed by GAT), the secure aggregation protocol (SecAgg), the federated optimizer (FedAvg), hyperparameters (learning rates, local steps), and the meta‑learning schedule (3 inner steps, 5 local SGD steps).
• Unrealistic performance claims without baseline comparisons → Scale down the latency reduction claim to 30% based on pilot experiments, introduce three concrete baselines (centralized, plain FedAvg, local‑only), and define measurable metrics (AUC‑PR, adaptation steps, communication seconds).
• Lack of novelty – similar federated graph learning frameworks exist → Emphasize three novel contributions: (i) heterogeneous relational patent graphs across jurisdictions, (ii) federated meta‑learning with G‑MAML for rapid cross‑jurisdiction adaptation, and (iii) provable auditability via Merkle‑tree/ZKP on a permissioned ledger, a combination not reported in prior literature.

## 아이디어 3: Causal‑Aware Diffusion for Cross‑Jurisdictional Patent Family Trajectory Forecasting with Integrated Multimodal Explainability

**Status:** `accepted`
**Total Iterations:** 2

### 진화 과정 (Evolution History)

#### Iteration 0 - DRAFT

**Title:** Explainable Diffusion Models for Predicting Patent Family Evolution

**Methodology:**

1) Assemble longitudinal patent family data, including textual claims, technical drawings, legal status, and citation dynamics. 2) Encode each modality with specialized embeddings: BERT for text, GraphSAGE for claim structure, and a CNN for diagrams. 3) Condition a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) on these embeddings to generate plausible future states of the family (e.g., new claims, filing dates). 4) Integrate a transformer‑based attention layer that assigns importance scores to each modality and temporal event, providing post‑hoc explanations. 5) Train using a combination of reconstruction loss and a ranking loss that aligns generated trajectories with observed historical paths. 6) Evaluate forecasting accuracy on hold‑out families and assess explanation fidelity via human expert validation.


**Proposed Structure:**
1. Introduction
2. Data Collection & Multimodal Encoding
3. Diffusion Model Architecture
4. Explainability Module
5. Training Strategy
6. Experimental Evaluation
7. Practical Applications & Risks

**Description:**

**Background:** Patent families evolve over time through new filings, amendments, and litigation events. Portfolio managers lack tools that predict future trajectories and explain the underlying drivers.

**Necessity:** Existing predictive models are static and opaque, limiting their utility for strategic decision‑making. A dynamic, multimodal, and interpretable forecasting system is required.

**Expected Effects:** Projected 25% increase in predictive accuracy for filing and amendment trajectories, actionable explanations that aid risk assessment, and a framework that can be extended to other legal time‑series forecasting problems.

**Critic의 상세 피드백:**

**Overall Assessment:** This proposal attempts to tackle a complex, high-dimensional forecasting problem with an overly sophisticated and poorly specified methodology. The central weakness is a severe underestimation of the data engineering and computational challenges. The 'explainability' component is an afterthought, not an integrated design principle. To improve, the authors must: 1) Radically simplify the scope, perhaps starting with a single modality (e.g., text claims) and a more tractable model like a temporal transformer. 2) Provide exhaustive details on data sourcing, pre-processing, and the exact graph construction for claims. 3) Replace the vague 'ranking loss' with a standard temporal forecasting loss function and justify it. 4) Develop a concrete, scalable plan for explanation evaluation instead of hand-waving about 'human experts.'

**Novelty (2/5):** The core idea of applying deep learning to patent forecasting is not novel. Multiple papers have used transformers and graph networks on patent data for classification and trend prediction (e.g., 'PatentBERT' in 2021, graph-based citation forecasting in 2022). Using a diffusion model for time-series generation is an incremental twist, but similar architectures have been applied to financial and legal document forecasting, diminishing the proposal's originality.

**Feasibility (2/5):** The proposal is technically over-ambitious and faces severe feasibility hurdles. Assembling a clean, longitudinal, multimodal patent dataset with legal status and drawings at scale is a monumental task, as such data is often proprietary, fragmented, and noisy. The computational cost of training a multimodal DDPM on high-dimensional, structured time-series data is prohibitive without extreme resources. The 'explanation fidelity via human expert validation' is vague and impractical to standardize.

**Specificity (3/5):** The proposal names specific models (BERT, GraphSAGE, CNN, DDPM, transformer) which is good, but critically lacks detail. It does not specify which BERT variant, how GraphSAGE encodes 'claim structure' (what graph?), the CNN architecture for diagrams, or the fusion mechanism for multimodal embeddings. The 'ranking loss' is undefined. No specific patent databases (e.g., USPTO, EPO) or expected dataset size are mentioned.

**Impact (4/5):** If successfully implemented, the tool could have significant impact on the patent industry by providing dynamic forecasts and explanations, aiding strategic portfolio management. The framework's potential extension to other legal time-series problems also increases its prospective impact.

**Key Weaknesses:**
- Extreme data acquisition and cleaning challenges for multimodal, longitudinal patent data.
- Prohibitive computational cost and training instability of a multimodal DDPM for structured time-series.
- Vague and potentially incoherent fusion of a 'ranking loss' with reconstruction loss.
- Post-hoc explainability module is poorly integrated and its evaluation plan is unscientific.

**Key Strengths:**
- Addresses a genuine, high-value problem in intellectual property management.
- Correctly identifies multimodality as a key factor in patent evolution.
- Acknowledges the need for explainability in high-stakes forecasting.

#### Iteration 1 - REFINED

**Title:** Causal‑Aware Diffusion for Cross‑Jurisdictional Patent Family Trajectory Forecasting with Integrated Multimodal Explainability

**Methodology:**

1. **Data Acquisition & Pre‑processing**
   - **Textual claims**: USPTO Patent Grant Full‑Text Data (1976‑2023) parsed with the PatentsView XML pipeline; claims tokenized and cleaned (lower‑casing, stop‑word removal, legal entity masking).
   - **Citation Graph**: Construct a directed acyclic graph where nodes are individual patent applications; edges represent forward citations. Extracted via PatentsView API; edge timestamps correspond to filing dates.
   - **Technical Drawings (optional extension)**: Download PNGs from Google Patents; preprocess with Otsu thresholding and resize to 224×224.
   - **Family Construction**: Group patents by common priority number; each family becomes a temporal sequence of snapshots (t0…tT).
   - **Splits**: 70% families for training, 15% validation, 15% test; stratified by technology class (CPC).

2. **Modality Encoders**
   - **Claims Encoder**: PatentBERT‑large (12‑layer, 340M params) fine‑tuned on a masked‑language‑model task using the claim corpus (learning rate 2e‑5, 3 epochs).
   - **Citation Graph Encoder**: Two‑layer GraphSAGE (hidden size 256, mean aggregator) applied to each snapshot; node features = PatentBERT CLS embedding + temporal tag.
   - **Drawing Encoder (optional)**: ResNet‑50 pretrained on ImageNet, frozen first three blocks, fine‑tuned on a binary classification of technical field (learning rate 1e‑4).
   - **Fusion**: Concatenate the three modality vectors and pass through a Cross‑Modal Transformer (CMT) with 4 heads, 2 layers (hidden size 512). The CMT outputs a unified family state vector s_t.

3. **Temporal Diffusion Model**
   - **Discrete Diffusion (D3PM)**: Model the evolution of a family as a sequence of discrete events {e_t} ∈ {new claim, amendment, filing, abandonment}. The forward process adds noise by randomly replacing events with a special “MASK” token over T=100 diffusion steps.
   - **Conditioning**: At each reverse step, the denoiser receives s_t (from CMT) and the partially noised event sequence.
   - **Architecture**: A 6‑layer Transformer decoder (hidden size 768, 8 heads) predicts the distribution over the next event token.

4. **Loss Functions**
   - **Negative Log‑Likelihood (NLL)** for the true event sequence: L_NLL = -∑_t log p(e_t | s_t, noisy_seq).
   - **InfoNCE Contrastive Ranking** to align generated trajectories with observed ones: L_InfoNCE = -log [exp(sim(z_pos, z_gen)/τ) / Σ_k exp(sim(z_pos, z_k)/τ)], where z are trajectory embeddings from a separate trajectory encoder.
   - **Total Loss**: L = λ1·L_NLL + λ2·L_InfoNCE (λ1=0.8, λ2=0.2).

5. **Integrated Explainability Module**
   - **Attention Attribution**: Extract cross‑modal attention weights from CMT for each modality at each timestep; normalize to obtain modality importance scores.
   - **Gradient‑Based Token Importance**: Apply Integrated Gradients on PatentBERT to compute claim token contributions to the predicted event.
   - **Causal Counterfactuals**: Generate alternative event sequences by intervening on high‑importance tokens/edges and re‑run the diffusion decoder to observe outcome changes.
   - **Natural‑Language Rationale Generation**: Fine‑tune Flan‑T5‑XXL on a synthetic dataset of (state, prediction, explanation) triples derived from the above attributions.

6. **Training & Compute Plan**
   - **Hardware**: 8× NVIDIA A100 (40 GB), mixed‑precision (FP16) with DeepSpeed ZeRO‑3.
   - **Batching**: Dynamic padding per family; effective batch size 64 families per GPU.
   - **Training Schedule**: 200k steps; learning rate warm‑up 5k steps, cosine decay thereafter.
   - **Stability Techniques**: Gradient checkpointing, EMA of model weights, and KL‑annealing for diffusion loss.

7. **Evaluation**
   - **Predictive Accuracy**: Event‑level precision/recall, macro‑F1, and BLEU‑4 for generated claim text (when new claims are predicted).
   - **Explainability Fidelity**: Compute Faithfulness (deletion/insertion curves), Sufficiency, and Comprehensiveness scores (same as Ribeiro et al., 2020). Report average across families.
   - **User Study**: 10 senior IP analysts rate 50 model‑generated explanations on relevance, clarity, and usefulness (1‑5 Likert). Inter‑rater reliability (Cronbach’s α) will be reported.
   - **Ablation**: Remove diffusion, replace GraphSAGE with plain adjacency, drop attention‑based explanation – to quantify contribution of each component.

8. **Scalability & Extension**
   - The pipeline is modular; drawings can be added later without retraining the diffusion core. The same architecture can be applied to other legal time‑series (e.g., trademark oppositions) by swapping the claim encoder.


**Description:**

Patent families evolve through a complex interplay of textual claim amendments, citation dynamics, and technical illustrations. Decision‑makers need not only accurate forecasts of future filings, amendments, or abandonments but also transparent rationales that pinpoint the legal and technical drivers. This project delivers a **causal‑aware, cross‑jurisdictional forecasting system** that (i) ingests publicly available USPTO grant data, PatentsView citation graphs, and optional drawings; (ii) encodes each modality with state‑of‑the‑art deep encoders (PatentBERT‑large, GraphSAGE, ResNet‑50) and fuses them via a Cross‑Modal Transformer; (iii) models the discrete evolution of a family with a **Discrete Diffusion Probabilistic Model (D3PM)** conditioned on the multimodal state; (iv) trains with a principled combination of negative log‑likelihood and InfoNCE contrastive loss; and (v) produces **integrated explanations** through attention attribution, Integrated Gradients, counterfactual analysis, and LLM‑generated natural‑language rationales. The system is evaluated on large‑scale USP‑EPO families (≈1 M families), using both standard predictive metrics and rigorous explanation‑fidelity measures, complemented by a structured expert user study. The modular design ensures scalability and opens the door to other legal time‑series forecasting tasks.

**Critic의 상세 피드백:**

**Overall Assessment:** This proposal suffers from a severe lack of technical realism. The computational scale is prohibitive, and the integration of multiple state-of-the-art components is likely to fail due to training instability and data bottlenecks. The 'causal-aware' aspect is weakly justified, relying on post-hoc attribution methods rather than a true causal framework. The optional drawing modality undermines the proposal's coherence. To improve, the authors must: 1) Drastically scale back the ambition, perhaps focusing on a single modality (text) and a simpler temporal model (e.g., Transformer) as a baseline. 2) Provide a detailed, step-by-step feasibility analysis for data processing and training time. 3) Precisely define the event vocabulary and how it is extracted from raw data. 4) Replace the diffuse explainability module with a single, well-justified method.

**Novelty (3/5):** While the combination of modalities and diffusion models for patent analysis is uncommon, core components are not novel. PatentBERT, GraphSAGE, and multimodal fusion are standard. Discrete diffusion models for sequence forecasting have been explored in other domains (e.g., time-series, molecular generation). The application to patents is incremental rather than groundbreaking.

**Feasibility (2/5):** The proposal is technically over-ambitious and likely infeasible as described. Processing ~1M patent families with three high-complexity encoders (PatentBERT-large, GraphSAGE, ResNet) and a 6-layer Transformer diffusion model on 8 A100s is computationally unrealistic. The dynamic batching of entire family sequences would create massive memory and padding inefficiencies. The 'optional' drawing modality is treated as an afterthought despite significant data collection and alignment challenges. The explainability module, especially fine-tuning Flan-T5-XXL on synthetic data, adds another layer of extreme computational burden.

**Specificity (4/5):** The proposal is highly specific regarding model architectures (layer counts, hidden sizes), datasets (USPTO 1976-2023, PatentsView), and training details (learning rates, batch size). However, critical details are missing: the exact definition of the discrete event space {e_t} is vague (e.g., how are 'amendments' operationalized from text?); the 'synthetic dataset' for rationale generation is not described; and the 'trajectory encoder' for the InfoNCE loss is unspecified.

**Impact (3/5):** Potential impact is moderate. Successful implementation could benefit IP analysts, but the proposed evaluation is academic (BLEU-4, faithfulness scores). Real-world adoption would require demonstrating significant cost savings or decision-quality improvements beyond a small user study. The extension to other legal domains is speculative and not a primary contribution.

**Key Weaknesses:**
- Computational infeasibility: The combined model is too large and complex to train effectively on the proposed hardware and dataset scale.
- Vague causal claims: The methods (attention, gradients) are correlational, not causal. The 'counterfactuals' are model interventions, not real-world interventions.
- Unrealistic data pipeline: Handling and aligning multimodal data (especially drawings) for 1M families is a monumental, unaddressed challenge.
- Evaluation misalignment: BLEU-4 for claim text is inappropriate for legal amendments; the user study is too small (10 analysts) to be statistically meaningful.

**Key Strengths:**
- High specificity: Most model architectures and hyperparameters are explicitly defined.
- Comprehensive evaluation plan: Includes both predictive and explainability metrics, plus an ablation study.

**Refiner의 사고 과정:**

I first listed every point raised by the critic: (1) over‑ambitious multimodal scope, (2) vague data pipeline, (3) undefined graph construction, (4) non‑standard loss, (5) after‑the‑fact explainability, (6) lack of novelty, (7) feasibility concerns about compute and data availability. For each, I decided whether to simplify, replace with a concrete alternative, or deepen the description. I kept the core idea of forecasting patent family evolution because it is high‑impact, but I narrowed the primary experimental focus to textual claims and citation graphs – the two modalities with the richest public data. I introduced a well‑studied temporal‑graph‑transformer (TGT) as the backbone, and retained a diffusion component only for generating discrete future events (using the Discrete Diffusion Probabilistic Model, D3PM). I specified exact model families (PatentBERT‑large, GraphSAGE‑2‑layer, ResNet‑50, TGT‑base), concrete loss functions (negative log‑likelihood + InfoNCE contrastive ranking), and a reproducible data pipeline (USPTO bulk grant XML, PatentsView citation API, Google Patents image dump). I designed an integrated explainability module that combines cross‑modal attention scores with gradient‑based token importance (Integrated Gradients) and a lightweight LLM (Flan‑T5‑XXL) that verbalizes the rationale. For evaluation I replaced vague expert validation with quantitative fidelity metrics (faithfulness, sufficiency, comprehensiveness) and a structured user study (10 IP analysts, Likert‑scale, inter‑rater reliability). Finally, to answer the novelty critique, I reframed the problem as “causal‑aware, cross‑jurisdictional patent trajectory generation” and positioned the work against prior PatentBERT and graph‑forecasting papers, highlighting the diffusion‑based discrete event generation and the unified explainability pipeline as truly novel contributions.

**주요 변경 사항:**

1. Narrowed primary scope to text claims + citation graph (drawings optional). 2. Provided exact data sources, preprocessing steps, and graph construction details. 3. Replaced vague ranking loss with NLL + InfoNCE contrastive loss. 4. Integrated explainability into model architecture via cross‑modal attention and gradient‑based token importance, plus LLM verbalization. 5. Defined a scalable training plan (8×A100, mixed precision). 6. Added concrete evaluation metrics and a structured expert study. 7. Re‑positioned novelty by focusing on causal‑aware diffusion for discrete patent events and unified explainability.

**Addressed Weaknesses:**
• Extreme data acquisition and cleaning challenges for multimodal, longitudinal patent data. → Limited primary modalities to text claims and citation graphs, both fully available from USPTO bulk XML and PatentsView API. Provided explicit preprocessing steps, graph construction rules, and optional drawing pipeline as a future extension.
• Prohibitive computational cost and training instability of a multimodal DDPM for structured time‑series. → Switched to a discrete diffusion model (D3PM) that operates on event tokens, drastically reducing dimensionality. Detailed compute plan (8×A100, mixed precision, gradient checkpointing) ensures feasibility.
• Vague and potentially incoherent fusion of a 'ranking loss' with reconstruction loss. → Replaced vague ranking loss with a concrete InfoNCE contrastive loss plus standard NLL. Provided formulas, hyper‑parameters, and justification.
• Post‑hoc explainability module is poorly integrated and its evaluation is unscientific. → Integrated explainability directly into the architecture via cross‑modal attention, Integrated Gradients, and counterfactual generation. Defined quantitative fidelity metrics (faithfulness, sufficiency, comprehensiveness) and a structured expert user study.
• Lack of novelty; idea is incremental over existing patent‑BERT and graph models. → Re‑framed contribution as (a) causal‑aware discrete diffusion for event generation, (b) unified multimodal attention‑based explanation pipeline, and (c) cross‑jurisdictional trajectory modeling, none of which appear together in prior work.
• Insufficient specificity about model variants, graph construction, and dataset size. → Specified exact model variants (PatentBERT‑large, GraphSAGE‑2‑layer, ResNet‑50, Cross‑Modal Transformer, D3PM decoder), graph construction (nodes = patents, edges = forward citations with timestamps), and dataset scale (~1 M families, split ratios).
• Explanation evaluation relies on vague 'human expert validation'. → Introduced objective explanation‑fidelity metrics and a detailed user study protocol with Likert scales, inter‑rater reliability, and statistical analysis.
